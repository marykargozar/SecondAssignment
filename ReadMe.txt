This project implements a simple text summarization tool using NLTK, which scores sentences based on word frequency and selects the top sentences to form a summary. The summarization ensures that the final summary does not exceed a specified context window limit. The code is easy to understand and can be easily adapted for different text inputs and context window limits.

1- Replace the input_text1 and input_text2 variables in the main function with the texts you want to summarize.
2-Execute the script to generate summaries for both input texts. The summaries will be saved in summary1.txt and summary2.txt files.
3- The script will print the summaries and a combined query to the console.
